title: Thoughts on how to go through life
---
Pardon the odd title, but itâ€™s hard to think of what else to call this. The impetus for this post was an [article](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/09/the-secrets-of-personal-finance/) by James Altucher on personal finance, which echoed a lot of the philosophy of one of my roommates here in college, so I felt like writing about my thoughts on the subject.
