Been a while. Wanted to freestyle draft some thoughts on learning.

I vaguely want to learn something mathematical or functional. Something like studying number theory, or doing a side project in Haskell or Scala. Not hacking, but crafting. Deliberate, intentional craftsmanship of something. Can be something small (probably *should* be something small, otherwise it won't get built),  but most importantly, should be something I want to work on. Something more compelling than games. That's the tricky part.

Right now i'm toying with the idea of a poker system following the actor model. I know the actor model just enough for this to be interesting, but not enough for it to be trivial. Main question is what language/system to build it with. Tools must be enjoyable, and the right barrier to use. I think it's probably best to stick with python for this, but maybe stick to functional paradigms.
