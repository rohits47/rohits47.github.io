Happy New Year! I've refreshed the layout and design based on [Roger Chapman's](http://rogchap.com) website, and found a more permanent home at [rohits47.com](http://rohits47.com), so hopefully I'll be blogging a lot more this year. I also want to journal more, so I'll try to follow [NaJoWriMo](http://najowrimo.org) which starts this month. Here's looking ahead to a productive and packed 2015!
